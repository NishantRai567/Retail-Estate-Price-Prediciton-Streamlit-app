# Retail-Estate-Price-Prediction-Streamlit-app

## Overview
This web app predicts the price of a property based on various user inputs related to the property. The user enters details such as median income,number of bedrooms etc., and the app uses a trained RandomForestRegressor model to predict the estimated price of the property. The inputs are stored in a pandas dataframe and passed through a data preprocessing pipeline to generate predictions.

## Features
- Predict Property Prices: The app predicts the price of real estate based on user inputs.
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for a smooth, interactive user experience.
- Data Preprocessing: Inputs are processed and transformed before being passed through the prediction model.
- Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a RandomForestRegressor model for accurate price predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Streamlit:For creating the web app interface.
- Pandas:For handling data input and manipulation.
- Scikit-learn:For implementing the RandomForestRegressor model.
- Python:Programming language for backend logic.

## How to Use the App

### 1.Run the App Locally

To run the app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NishantRai567/Retail-Estate-Price-Prediciton-Streamlit-app.git
```
2.Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
cd Retail-Estate-Price-Prediciton-Streamlit-app
```
3.Install Dependencies: Install the required dependencies from requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4.Run the App: Launch the Streamlit app locally:

```bash
streamlit run "Predicting retail prices.py"
```

5.Access the App: The app will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501, where you can input the property details and get price predictions.

### 2. Access the App Online

If you donâ€™t want to run the app locally, you can access the app directly via its deployment on Streamlit Sharing or another cloud platform.

Visit the deployed app at: https://retail-estate-price-prediciton-app-app-gvqobwekarnppdm2a9bdj8.streamlit.app/

Once on the site, you can enter the required property details and receive the predicted price.
